`@watheia/app.envs.tailwind-react` is a customized extension for the bit react environment, located at [React Aspect](https://bit.dev/teambit/react/react).

Explain here the modified configurations and tools applied.

## Basic Usage

Add variant rules similar to the example in your `workspace.jsonc`...

The important part is assigning a variant to the `watheia.app/envs/tailwind-react` environment as shown in the last rule.

```json
{
  "teambit.workspace/variants": {
    "{env/*}, {apps/*}": {
      "teambit.harmony/aspect": {}
    },
    "{ui/*}": {
      "watheia.app/envs/tailwind-react": {}
    }
  }
}
```
